# 2d-game
Its a epic 2d game, it isnt finished yet but its worth it to take a look.

The game made only using Javascript, CSS and HTML. Feel free to take a look.

As I said earlier, the game is not finished yet. It has only a shoot mechanic and there are some random neutral entities. I am working on it
so dont worry. It also has only one level, yes only one. 

I thought maybe its epic to share the game with people on github, to let them see what you can do with Javascript canvas.
